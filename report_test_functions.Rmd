## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Packages + setup, }
source("main.R") # load functions
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Load Data
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
data <- load_data('GSE64403_FPKM_table.txt')
```
Sample Info Exploration
```{r}
cs <- column_summary(data)
print(cs)
p <- plot_continous_var(data)
print(p)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
